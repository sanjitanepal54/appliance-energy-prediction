## Appliance Energy Prediction Project 

This project aims to predict the energy consumption of household appliances using various regression models and time series analysis techniques.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the energy usage of different household appliances. The project explores the effectiveness of various regression models and incorporates time series analysis to capture temporal patterns and trends in energy consumption.


## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing historical energy consumption records of temperatures, pressure, humidity in the room and wind speed in the room. The dataset includes information such as timestamps and weather conditions. The data is preprocessed and prepared for regression modeling and time series analysis.

## Models

Several regression models are implemented and compared to predict appliance energy consumption. The following models are explored:

1. Lasso regression
2. Ridge regression
3. Support vector regression
4. KNeighborsRegressor
5. Random Forest Regressor
6. Gradient Boosting Regressor
7. ExtraTrees Regressor
8. Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost

The models are trained on the available data and evaluated based on their performance metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared value.


## Results

The project presents the comparative analysis of the different regressor models and time series analysis techniques. The evaluation results, including model performance metrics and insights from time series analysis, are discussed and visualized using appropriate plots and charts.
